            <strong>What is electron exactly?</strong>
            <p>
              electron is a web application under development designed to be an easy to setup
              and easy to use solution for solo or remote audio waveform creation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What should I do if it does not work properly?</strong>
            <p>
              First of all, make sure you are visiting the web application using the latest version
              of Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Other browsers have not been tested.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>What does A.M. mean?</strong>
            <p>
              A.M. stands for Amplitude Modulation. Basically it means the signal's amplitude (volume)
              will be altered following the shape of another wave. A quick example: If you have your volume
              set to 55% and set A.M. Type to Sine, A.M. Depth to 13% and A.M. Frequency to 3Hz that means
              the signal will oscillate between 42% (55-13) and 68% (55+13) three times per second (3Hz) following
              a sine wave's shape (i.e. smoothly).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How do I use it?</strong>
            <p>
              First of all the driver should get into the website and click the "Create Session" button.
              There, they will get a Session ID, which will look something like "73cJMc9Plx", it's a combination
              of 10 letters and numbers. Afterwards, any number of riders can get into the website and paste
              that code into the input field that says "Session ID" under the Join Session section. After doing
              that, they will be taken to the sound player screen and any changes the driver makes to the signal
              will be sent to them and played. Please keep in mind that the Session Id is case-sensitive and
              sometimes a lowercase "L" and an uppercase "I" can look very similar. The best way to go is to
              copy and paste.

            <strong>Does it work on mobile devices?</strong>
            <p>
              I have only ran very few and very quick tests but it would seem the answer is yes! At least
              using Google Chrome on the latest version of Android. That would mean you could drive or be
              driven pretty much anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection handy.
              Being driven around on public is now a very real possibility.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>I am being rejected as a driver! What do I do?</strong>
            <p>
              You are probably trying to drive a session someone else is driving. Or perhaps you
              simply refreshed the page while driving someone. If you do that <strong>you will lose
                control of the session forever</strong>. electron is a stateless application, which
              means we do not track who's doing what. If you close a session you were driving and open
              it again or even refresh the page you will lose control of the session. The good part
              is that you can easily create a new one and make people join again!

            <strong>What license is this software distributed under?</strong>
            <p>

              desire with the software and that no warranty of any kind is given so the author shall not be
